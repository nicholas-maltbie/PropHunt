# PropHunt

Attempt to create a PropHunt simple game with unity for fun based of the
Gmod game mode.

# Game

Players will be in two teams, prop and hunter.

Props will hide and can disguise themselves as objects in the environment.

Hunters will chase props around the map searching for props.

Props get a small amount of time to hide before hunters track them down and
try to find them.
